Glasgow Subway concept – Which End's First Out?

 - Specify where you're travelling from ("fae", in Glaswegian vernacular);
 - Specify where you're travelling to ("tae", in Glaswegian vernacular);
 - Learn at which end you should board the train, to arrive near to the exit at your destination.

**NOTE** – Merely a PoC, for now – no guarantee correct results will be returned!
